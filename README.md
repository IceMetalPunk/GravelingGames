## Dead Like Me: Graveling Games
Graveling Games is a puzzle RPG game based on the mythology and characters of the Dead Like Me television series. You begin as Georgia "George" Lass...and you have just died. Now that you're an undead reaper, it's your job to take peoples' souls before the Gravelings ensure they meet their appointment with death. To do that, you must engage the Gravelings in puzzle minigames to keep them off your tail long enough to find the target and reap his soul. Don't take too long, though; if you miss the appointment, you'll fail the reap and doom the target to an eternity trapped in their own, dead bodies!

### TODO List:
* Conquest mini-game
  * Rotate your nodes to capture all free nodes along the path, gaining their energy. When no free nodes exist, board is reset and randomized.
* Main menu
* Battle system
  * Gaining energy fills the bar of its color. After your turn, energy bars are drained and used for attack, which is blocked by opponents' defense scores.
  * Each character's special color will also fill its special bar, which dooesn't drain.
   * When filled, the special bar can be tapped to unleash a special move that helps you in the game
   * Mason's randomizes colors on the board.
   * Roxie's destroys and collects an area of colors of your choice.
   * George's highlihgts the best move to make.
   * Daisy's changes an area of colors to match your strongest color (other than her own special)
   * Betty's increases your attack strength for some number of turns.
   * Rube's increases your defense for some number of turns.
* Soul Shifting mini-game
  * Basic gem-swapping, color-matching puzzle. Uninspired but obligatory
* Level selection
  * Levels are Post-Its with names, times, and locations of death; laid out in an overworld-path style, with new ones appearing as you complete previous ones.
* Timer system
  * Each level starts at a certain time, and you have until the appointment time to "find the target"--beat every minigame person on the map.
  * Time only ticks when you're making your move in a mini-game, not in the world or during opponents' turns.
  * When you beat everyone in a level, if you do in time, the target's minigame begins, which is a little harder than the others.
  * If you don't make it in time, you have to restart the current level (perhaps with a handicap of extra time?)
* Reaper Glass
  * Rare hourglass power-up that spawns in every game; if you collect it, it rolls back your clock to give you more time to complete the level.
* Reaper battles
  * You start with just George; at the end of certain levels, you meet and must mini-game-battle a new reaper to unlock them as a playable character.
  * Meeting order is similar to the TV show: Rube, then Betty, then Mason, then Roxie, then Daisy.
* Rayling battles?
  * Perhaps the Rayling (Ray Graveling) can be a miniboss? Or maybe he doesn't need to be in the game? Food for thought.
* Other mini-games
* Actual level progression design
